Working of Pop Up:

The pop up will slide in from the top of the viewport.
The pop up contains cards with "Coupon Code" as a heading.
If the user clicks on the "COPY CODE" button of a card, the respective coupon code of that card should be copied in the Clipboard accordingly.
Clicking on the close icon will remove the pop up with slide up animation.
